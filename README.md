 Code for analysis of mobile apps is in "Code " folder - code.R.
 
 Code for simulation study is in "Code " folder - simulation.R.
 
 Code for analysis including code metrics is in "Code" folder - with_code_metric.r
 
 Code of running analysis of NPM packages in "Code/NPM" folder.
 
 Results in the paper and the distribution of variablesare in "Results" folder.
 
 Data is in "Data" folder.
 
 ## Instructions for running code
 
 1. Set appropriate file path to point to the folder containing data.
 1. Install required libraries, if needed.
 1. Load the file and run, functions of different sections are commented in the code.
 1. For the BN models, choosing appropriate threshold values based on the result of the particular run is recommended.
