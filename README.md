# Release Quality Model for a Mobile Software

 Code is in "Code " folder.
 
 Results in the paper and the distribution of variables (log-transformed and scaled) are in "Results" folder.
 
 Data is in "Data" folder.
 
 ## Instructions for running code
 
 1. Set appropriate file path to point to the folder containing data.
 1. Install required libraries, if needed.
 1. Load the file and run, functions of different sections are commented in the code.
 1. For the BN models, choosing appropriate threshold values based on the result of the particular run is recommended.

### Note: There might be slight differences in the BN structures or the R-squared values reported by Random Forest models, but that should not affect the claims made in the paper.
